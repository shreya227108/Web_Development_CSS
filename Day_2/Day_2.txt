#Syntax Explaination:

    h2{
        color:rebeccapurple;
    }

Here,
h1=selector(It selects the aspects or tags in html file to be styled)
color=Property(It defines property to be applied on tag)
purple=Value(It is the value given to property)
{}=Brackets

#Types of Styling

1.Inline style
-Style is added in tag of selector in html file.
Ex: <h1 style="color:green;">Hello Everyone in green</h1>
Here the color is given to the text in the same line in html file only.

2.Interal Styling
-Style tag is added in head tag in html file using selector.
Ex: h2{
        color:rebeccapurple;
    }
Here the color is given to the text by adding style tag in html file.

3.External Styling
-Style is added by creating new style.css file and linking through link tag.
Ex: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
Here,
link=Tag used to connect css file to html file.
rel=Represent relation between two files being linked.
href=path of the file which is linked.
Hence the tags are written in html and they are styled with the help of style.css

NOTE: If we overwrite the style of a tag already written in external style with 
inline or internal styling, it will prioritize the inline or internal styling,
to avoid this mostly use external styling method.
