CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation (look and layout) of a document written in HTML.

It controls how web elements appear on the screen — including their colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

#Why Use CSS?
-Separation of content and design (HTML = content, CSS = style)

-Better user experience — makes sites more attractive and readable
-Responsive Design — helps create layouts that work on all screen sizes

-Media Queries: Adapt design to different devices and screen sizes
