Today we will learn about the FlexBox(Flexible Box Layout)

-It is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns.
-To use felxbox and its properties we have to set the display of element to flex.


#Flexbox Direction
It sets how flex items are placed in the flex container, along which axis and direction.
                                    Dir of main axix
flex-direction : row; (default)     :left to right
flex-direction : row-reverse;       :right to left
