Lets learn about Display Property.

#Display Property
-With display property we cans change a display type and its working of an element on webpage
-types of display properties: inline / block / inline-block / none
    -inline - Takes only the space required by the element. (no margin/ padding)
    -block - Takes full space available in width.
    -inline-block - Similar to inline but we can set margin & padding.
    -none - To remove element from document flow along with its space.

#Visibility
-visibility: hidden;
-To remove element from document flow but its space is reserved.

Note : When visibility is set to none, space for the element is reserved.
But for display set to none, no space is reserved or blocked for the
element.

#Alpha Channel
-represents the opacity (transparency level) of a color in digital graphics, including CSS.
-It varies from 0 to 1
    0=not visible
    1=completely visible
